# Backend API

## Overview

This repository contains the backend for a video search system built with FastAPI. The backend integrates with Elasticsearch for searching text data and uses backup files as a fallback mechanism. The system supports querying OCR, ASR, and object detection data. Additionally, it utilizes CLIP and FAISS for efficient image and text retrieval.

## Features

- Search text data in Elasticsearch.
- Fallback to backup files if Elasticsearch is unavailable.
- Fuzzy search support in backup data.
- Handles video metadata including video paths and frame ranges.
- Utilizes CLIP for image and text feature extraction.
- Uses FAISS for efficient similarity search and retrieval.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Conda for environment management
